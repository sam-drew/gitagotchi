# Gitagotchi

A handy git visualisation tool, which looks a bit like a Tamagotchi.

Gitagotchi scans all directories below your home directory, finds git repositories, and watches them for changes. When a change occurs, it checks the git status of that repository, and updates the UI accordingly.

Eventually, I would like for Gitagotchi to be happier more often based on your Git activity, but I don't think that doing it purely based on frequency is a good idea, so am leaving this for now.
